## 👁️ Vision: "Thinking with Images"

> *"The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend."* – Robertson Davies

Humans don't just passively observe; we actively engage with visual information, sketching, highlighting, and manipulating it to understand. OpenThinkIMG aims to bring this interactive visual cognition to AI, enabling agents that can genuinely "think with images."

## 🤔 What is OpenThinkIMG?

OpenThinkIMG is an end-to-end open-source framework that empowers Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to think with images. It features:
*   Flexible vision tool management and easy integration of new tools.
*   Efficient dynamic inference with distributed tool deployment.
*   A streamlined SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and Agent-RL (Reinforcement Learning) training pipeline, including our novel **V-ToolRL** method.

Our goal is to enable AI agents to interactively use visual tools to decompose, analyze, and solve complex visual problems, moving beyond passive observation towards active visual cognition.

---

## 🐚 Why OpenThinkIMG?

Current LVLMs excel at many tasks but often struggle when:
*   Deep, iterative visual reasoning is required, not just single-pass description.
*   Precise interaction with visual content (e.g., reading specific chart values, identifying exact locations) is crucial.
*   Generalizing learned tool-use to new scenarios dynamically.

OpenThinkIMG addresses these challenges by:

*   **Bridging the Gap to Human-like Visual Cognition**: We enable LVLMs to "think with images" by actively using a suite of visual tools, much like humans use sketches or highlights to understand complex scenes.
*   **Standardizing a Fragmented Landscape**: The current ecosystem for vision tools lacks unification. OpenThinkIMG provides:
    *   **Unified Tool Interfaces**: A standardized way to define and interact with diverse visual tools.
    *   **Modular, Distributed Deployment**: Tools run as independent services, enhancing scalability, fault isolation, and resource management.
*   **Moving Beyond Static SFT Limitations**: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on fixed trajectories often leads to poor generalization and lacks adaptability. We introduce:
    *   **V-ToolRL for Adaptive Policies**: Our novel reinforcement learning framework allows agents to *autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies* by directly optimizing for task success through interaction and feedback. This leads to significantly better performance and adaptability compared to SFT-only approaches.
*   **Driving Reproducible Research**: By open-sourcing the entire framework, we aim to provide a common platform for the community to build upon, experiment with, and advance the field of tool-augmented visual reasoning.

---

## 🚧 Project Status

OpenThinkIMG is currently an **alpha release** but is actively being developed. The core end-to-end system, including tool integration, trajectory generation, SFT (Cold-Start), and V-ToolRL training, is functional and can be used to replicate the results in our paper.

The project team is actively working on the following key milestones:

*   **🥇 Release of Pre-trained Models**: Providing readily usable SFT-initialized and V-ToolRL-trained agent models (e.g., based on Qwen2-VL-2B).
*   **🛠️ Expanding the Vision Toolset**: Integrating more diverse and powerful vision tools (e.g., advanced image editing, 3D analysis tools).
*   **🤖 Broader LVLM Backbone Support**: Adding easy integration for more open-source LVLMs (e.g., LLaVA series, MiniGPT-4).
*   **📊 More Benchmarks & Evaluation Suites**: Extending evaluation to a wider range of visual reasoning tasks beyond chart reasoning.
*   **🌐 Community Building**: Fostering an active community through GitHub discussions, contributions, and collaborations.

We welcome contributions and feedback to help us achieve these goals!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🔌 Step 1: Launch Vision Tool Services

To enable tool-enhanced inference, start all vision tools before using the inferencer. Each tool runs independently and is launched via a unified config.

```bash
## First, modify the config to adapt to your own environment
## tool_server/tool_workers/scripts/launch_scripts/config/all_service_szc.yaml

## Start all services
cd tool_server/tool_workers/scripts/launch_scripts
python start_server_config.py --config ./config/all_service.yaml

## Press control + C to shutdown all services automatically.
```

### 🔍 Step 2: Run Inference with OpenThinkIMG

#### ✅ Option 1: Direct Evaluation (e.g., Qwen2VL on ChartGemma)

```bash
accelerate launch  --config_file  ${accelerate_config} \
-m tool_server.tf_eval \
--model qwen2vl \
--model_args pretrained=Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct \
--task_name chartgemma \
--verbosity INFO \
--output_path ./tool_server/tf_eval/scripts/logs/results/chartgemma/qwen2vl.jsonl \
--batch_size 2 \
--max_rounds 3 \
--stop_token <stop> 
```

#### 🧩 Option 2: Evaluation via Config File (Recommended)


```bash
accelerate launch  --config_file  ${accelerate_config} \
-m tool_server.tf_eval \
--config ${config_file}
```

#### Config file example:

```yaml
- model_args:
    model: qwen2vl
    model_args: pretrained=Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct
    batch_size: 2
    max_rounds: 3
    stop_token: <stop>
  task_args:
    task_name: chartgemma
    resume_from_ckpt:
      chartgemma: ./tool_server/tf_eval/scripts/logs/ckpt/chartgemma/qwen2vl.jsonl
    save_to_ckpt:
      chartgemma: ./tool_server/tf_eval/scripts/logs/ckpt/chartgemma/qwen2vl.jsonl
  script_args:
    verbosity: INFO
    output_path: ./tool_server/tf_eval/scripts/logs/results/chartgemma/qwen2vl.jsonl
```

For detailed information and config setting please refer to our [documentation](docs/README.md).



## 🧠 Training

Once the vision tools are properly deployed, we provide a flexible training pipeline to teach models **how to plan and invoke tools** effectively through **SFT** and our proposed **V-ToolRL** methods.

Our training pipeline builds on the solid foundation of [OpenR1](https://github.com/OpenR1), integrating visual tools as external reasoning capabilities.

### 📦 Install Additional Dependencies

To run the training code, make sure to install the additional required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements_train.txt
```

### 🔁 V-ToolRL: Reinforcement Learning with Vision Tools

We provide a customized implementation of V-ToolRL for training models to leverage vision tools dynamically in complex tasks.

```
torchrun --nproc_per_node=${nproc_per_node} \
    --nnodes="1" \
    --node_rank="0" \
    --master_addr="127.0.0.1" \
    --master_port=${master_port} \
    src/open_r1/tool_grpo.py --use_vllm True \
    --output_dir ${output_dir} \
    --model_name_or_path ${model_path} \
    --dataset_name ${data_path} \
    --max_prompt_length 16000 \

    --save_only_model true \
    --controller_addr http://SH-IDCA1404-10-140-54-15:20001 \
    --use_tool true
```

> 📈  This helps the model learn **dynamic planning & tool invocation** using environment feedback.

### 🧪 SFT: Supervised Fine-Tuning

We also support supervised fine-tuning for training models on curated tool usage demonstrations. Modify the config according to your use case:

```
    accelerate launch --num_machines 1 --num_processes 6 --main_process_port 29502 --multi_gpu\
    src/open_r1/sft.py \
    --output_dir ${output_dir} \
    --model_name_or_path ${model_path} \
    --dataset_name ${data_path} \
    --seed 42 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --max_seq_length 4096 \
    --deepspeed config/deepspeed/ds_z3_offload_config.json \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 2 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --report_to wandb \
    --gradient_checkpointing true \
    --attn_implementation flash_attention_2 \
    --bf16 \
    --num_train_epochs 2 \
    --run_name $RUN_NAME \
    --save_steps 100 \
    --warmup_ratio 0.1 \
    --save_only_model true
```
